# Work Space for COMP 210: Data Structures and Analysis.

This course teaches us how to organize the data used in computer programs so that manipulation of that data can be done efficiently on large problems and large data instances. Rather than learning to use the data structures found in the libraries of programming languages, we will be learning how those libraries are constructed, and why the items that are included in them are there (and why some are excluded).
